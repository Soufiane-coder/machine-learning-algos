# Readme

This file is for machine learning with basic instructions and their equivalent with library already built in.

Files are build in this format:

- Name of the type of the algorithm
  - Name of the category of the algorithm
    - scratch file `scratch` that contains the scratch version of alorithm
    - library file `library` that contains the library version of alorithm
  - `readme.md` file that contains a description of the category
